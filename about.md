Code.mil is a product of the Defense Digital Service [dds.mil](https://dds.mil) and of collaborators from around the DoD and [Military Open Source Software](http://www.mil-oss.org/) community. It's an effort to adapt the norms of free and open software development to the specific needs of the DoD. For the rest of the US Government see the efforts at [code.gov](https://code.gov).
