1. **How do I open source my work?** First determine if your code is appropriate to release, whether it is ready to release, and whether there is any explicit policy [guidance from your DoD organization](../agency.html). Next get your code ready be establishing clear source code provenance and meeting existing open source community software engineering norms (version control, regression testing, ...). Then choose a license, and follow the regulations of your organization for releasing information to the public. Contact [dds.mil](https://dds.mil) for help.

1. **How can I contribute?** You can always contribute as a US Citizen, but as a federal employee you should ensure with your supervisory chain that contributions to any open source project are appropriate for your work.

1. **How do I accept community contributions?** As part of your licensing approach you will develop a Contributing License Agreement that governs how outside contributors holding copyright will license their contributions. As part of your software engineering approach you will develop version control, review, and testing procedures to ensure that outside contributions are appropriate to merge back into the source.
