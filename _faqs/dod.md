1. **How do I open source my work?** First determine if your code is appropriate to release, whether it is ready to release, and whether there is any explicit policy [guidance from your DoD organization](../agency.html). Next get your code ready be establishing clear source code provenance and meeting existing open source community software engineering norms (version control, regression testing, ...). Then choose a license, and follow the regulations of your organization for releasing information to the public. Contact [dds.mil](https://dds.mil) for help.

1. **How can I contribute?** You can always contribute as a US Citizen, but as a federal employee you should ensure with your supervisory chain that contributions to any open source project are appropriate for your work.

1. **How do I accept community contributions?** As part of your licensing approach you will develop a Contributing License Agreement that governs how outside contributors holding copyright will license their contributions. As part of your software engineering approach you will develop version control, review, and testing procedures to ensure that outside contributions are appropriate to merge back into the source.

1. **I am part of DoD or a Military Department and want to have my project hosted on Code.mil. What do I do?**
That's awesome! Please get the conversation going by [submitting your information here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSebDzfqkH8ANSuqQFqValypmceVxNfEzOxMURfQQBAt4IgFQw/viewform?usp=sf_link) so we can start talking.

1. **What is the liability of a contributor?**
Under the DCO, a contribution is submitted under the open source license associated with the project, which will have warranty and liability disclaimers. The licenses we are considering disclaim warranties and provide the code AS IS.

1. **What do I need to know if I fork a project?**
What you need to do if you fork a project depends on the status of the project at the time you fork it. A proposed structure is [presented here](https://github.com/deptofdefense/code.mil/tree/master/Proposal). Per INTENT.md, the intent is that the project should be treated as if it is licensed under the license associated with the project in the LICENSE.md file. Whether LICENSE.md has actually attached depends on the status of the project at the time you fork it. If the project includes no copyrighted code (so there have been no merged copyrighted contributions and your jurisdiction does not recognize copyright for U.S. Government-written work), then 'LICENSE.md' has not attached to the project. If the project includes copyrighted code (so there are merged copyrighted contributions or your jurisdiction recognizes copyright for U.S. Government-written work), then LICENSE.md has attached to the project and you must comply with the terms of the license. The authors and contributors are listed in CONTRIBUTORS.md and, in some cases, the source file headers.
