Code.mil is an initiative in open source at the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). The goal is to foster open collaboration with the developer community and make code developed by U.S. Federal employees in support of DoD programs available for reuse and collaboration not only across the rest of government, but the public too.

Code.mil launched on February 22, 2017 by releasing a draft open source strategy for code written by DoD employees and calling upon the developer and legal communities across the Federal government and private sector for feedback. You can read the official [press release here](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Releases/News-Release-View/Article/1092364/dod-announces-the-launch-of-codemil-an-experiment-in-open-source). We finalized the strategy and launched our first open source projects under this strategy on March 13, 2017. You can read about it [here](https://medium.com/@DefenseDigitalService/code-mil-an-open-source-initiative-at-the-pentagon-5ae4986b79bc#.tphs4mxqp).

U.S. military members and their families make significant sacrifices to protect our country. Their lives should not be negatively impacted by outdated tools and software development practices that lag far behind private sector standards.

Modern software is open sourced software. The creative contribution of individual developers to help solve complex problems of impact is largely untapped by DoD. There is a significant resource of developer talent within the DoD that would love to leverage some of the modern tools used in the tech industry to share code and ideas. Likewise, there are many skilled developers in the private sector who would love to contribute to strengthening software developed within the government.

Through this experiment, we are trying to more actively participate in the open source and free software communities. We need your help to build better software products and services for our military members and citizens across the country.

Opening up DoD codebases for the world to see allows code vulnerabilities to be identified and remediated more quickly than current internal methods. This crowdsourced concept is similar to how public bug bounties like Hack the Pentagon were successful in allowing the public to aid the DoD in identifying and fixing bugs faster and at a lower cost than the DoD could on its own.

Giving everyone the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve software developed by DoD is a public good from which everyone should benefit. This is especially true considering that much of the code developed by the Federal government is funded by taxpayer dollars. This is one of the reasons why we are releasing our own custom-developed code on Code.mil.

The [Defense Digital Service (DDS)](https://dds.mil/) launched Code.mil on February 22, 2017. DDS, established on November 18, 2015 by the Secretary of Defense, brings in the best private sector talent, technology, and processes to DoD. DDS functions like a SWAT team of nerds working on high impact challenges during one to two year tours of duty as federal employees. DDS is an agency team of the [United States Digital Service](https://usds.gov/).

DDS has collaborated extensively with organizations in the open source and free software communities, such as the Free Software Foundation (FSF), the Open Source Initiative (OSI), and GitHub. DDS also reached out to open source experts and attorneys across the U.S. Federal government and in the private sector.

We launched Code.mil to further the mission of [Code.gov](https://code.gov) within DoD. The White House launched Code.gov last November, which is the Federal government’s primary platform for code sharing and reuse. Code.mil is our direct implementation of this mission to “improve access to the Federal government’s custom developed software.” We are in close collaboration with the team at Code.gov to expand upon government reuse and public access to custom-developed Federal source code. Projects hosted on Code.mil will also be accessible through the Code.gov platform.

Works created by U.S. Federal government employees within the scope of their employment is ineligible for copyright protections in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. People sometimes say that U.S. law requires Federal government employees to put creative works in the public domain, but that's not quite right. The U.S. Copyright Act does not explicitly define public domain. What the Act actually does is make works created by U.S. Federal government employees ineligible for copyright protections (17 U.S.C. 105). Public domain is generally understood to refer to creative materials that are not protected by intellectual property laws such as copyright, trademark, or patent laws. Under U.S. laws, Government-created works may be eligible for patent or trademark protections. Not all countries acknowledge the concept of public domain.

The updated strategy in [`INTENT.md`](https://github.com/deptofdefense/code.mil/blob/master/Proposal/INTENT.md) does not attempt to attach licenses to Government-written code. Rather, the strategy attaches the license to copyrighted contributions by using the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) process and to Government-written code in countries where that code is eligible for copyright protections.

          Why not just put Government-written code in the public domain and use CC0 1.0 Universal for copyrighted contributions and jurisdictions where you have copyright?

Good point! We definitely considered this. CC0 1.0 Universal seeks to dedicate copyrighted work to the public domain by waiving the author's rights to the work worldwide under copyright law. Using CC0 1.0 Universal is one possibility, but not the only one. There are many high quality and widely adopted open source and free software licenses, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. We are not intending to judge the merit of using CC0 1.0 Universal. Rather, we are positing that the project maintainer should have the freedom of choice when it comes to selecting the "best" license for that particular project. 

Intelligent minds will differ on the "best" avenue for a U.S. Federal government agency to participate in open source. The reality is that every organization, and every project, has unique circumstances that affect which option might make the most sense. This initiative is not intended to set DoD policy, but rather is exploring alternate ways for joining the open source community.

We recommend using the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org) process. The DCO is a legally binding statement asserting that you are the creator of your contribution, or that you otherwise have the authority to distribute the contribution, and that you are intentionally making the contribution available under the license associated with the project. The intent is to use widely adopted open source and free software licenses.

We considered other mechanisms, such as a Contributor Licensing Agreement or copyright assignment, but chose DCO because it reuses the license associated with the project rather than crafting new licensing language; is not administratively burdensome to implement; and is commonly used in the developer community.

Ultimately this is just a recommendation; a project's owner, maintainer, or organization may create their own policies and procedures.

Under the DCO, a contribution is submitted under the open source license associated with the project, which will have warranty and liability disclaimers. The licenses we are considering disclaim warranties and provide the code AS IS.
